Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive sales analysis for a coffee retail dataset using Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing, and Tableau for interactive data visualization. The goal is to derive actionable business insights that can support sales strategy, regional performance review, and product category analysis.

Data Preparation (Excel)
	•	Data Cleaning & Completion:
	◦	Used XLOOKUP, IF, and INDEX functions to fill in missing or inconsistent values and to standardize fields across different tables.

Data Visualization (Tableau)
	•	Designed an interactive dashboard highlighting:
	◦	top customers
	◦	total sales of product over time
	◦	Regional Performance Analysis
	◦	sales by country
The dashboard enables dynamic filtering to explore performance by loyalty, product type, sales and profits.
